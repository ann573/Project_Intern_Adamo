            your Facebook account, Google+ or other social networks (hereafter, the “Social Networks” or “Social
            Network”) that may match access to “My Account” in the future. As part of the functionality of the Website,
            and in order to offer a better customized experience, you may link your account to Social Networks in two

              corresponding Social Network, and Ojimah not being liable for paying any rate or regarding any use
              limitation imposed by external service vendors of the Social Network. By granting Ojimah access to any
